  "body": "Note to Students \n      This little book is not intended to be a textbook for a course dealing with an introduction to constructing and writing mathematical proofs. It is intended to be a reference book for students who need to construct and write proofs in their upper division mathematics courses. So it is assumed that students who use this as a reference have already taken an “introduction to proofs” course.\n     \n      With the exception of  , each chapter in the book has a description of a proof technique along with some justification as to why it is a valid proof method. There are then one or two completed proofs written according to the writing guidelines for mathematical proofs in  . The intent is to illustrate a well-written proof for that particular proof method. Each chapter then ends with three to five practice problems, most of which deal with mathematical proofs. Completed proofs (or solutions) for the practice problems are contained in  . So students can check their work or see other examples of well-written proofs.   contains most of the definitions used in the first six chapters of this book and a short summary of some logic that is pertinent to constructing mathematical proofs.\n     \n      The proofs in this book primarily use the concepts of even and odd integers, the concept of one integer dividing another, and the concept of congruence in the integers. Most of this book is based on material in chapter 3 of the book  Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof, Version 3  by Ted Sundstrom, which is a textbook for an “introduction to proofs” course. It is free to download as a pdf file at\n       https:\/\/scholarworks.gvsu.edu\/books\/24\/ \n     \n      A printed version of this book is also available on amazon.com for $22 at\n       http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/1qt \n     \n      Finally, there is a website for  Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof, Version 3 .

We will start with the backwards process. Please keep in mind that it is a good idea to write all of this down on paper. We should not try to construct a proof in our heads. Writing h\n   \n    So we first know that the goal is to prove that  . So a  backwards question  is,  How do we prove  ?  We may be able to answer this question in different ways depending on whether or not we have some previously proven results, but we can always use the definition. So an answer to this question is,  We can prove that 8 divides  .  We now ask,  How can we prove that 8 divides  ?  Again, we can use the definition and answer that we can prove that there exists an integer   such that  . So here is what we should have written down.\n\n     \n         \n           :  \n         \n       \n         \n           : 8 divides  \n         \n       \n         \n           : There exists and integer   such that  \n         \n       \n\n    The idea is that if we can prove that   is true, then we can conclude that   is true, and then we can conclude that   is true.   is a good place to stop the backwards process since it involves proving that something exists and we have an equation with which to work. So we start the forwards process. We start by writing down the assumptions stated in the hypothesis of the proposition and then make conclusions based on these assumptions. While doing this, we look at the items in the backward process and try to find ways to connect the conclusions in the forward process to the backward process. The forward process can be summarized as\n\n     \n         \n           :   and   are integers and   and  .\n         \n       \n         \n           : 8 divides   and 8 divides  .\n         \n       \n         \n           : There exists and integer   such that   and there exists and integer   such that  \n         \n       \n\n    It now seems that there is a way to connect the forward part ( ) to the backward part   using the existence of   and   (which have been proven to exist) and the equations in   and  .\n   \n    Solving the two equations in   for   and  , we obtain   and  . We can now use these in  .\n   Important Notes \n       \n           \n            We used the letter   in step   and so we could not use that again in the forward process since there is no way of guaranteeing that the same integer produces the equations for the equations in   and  .\n           \n         \n           \n            In the proof, we cannot use the integer represent by   in   since we have not proven that such an integer exists. The goal is to prove that such an integer exists.\n           \n         \n     \n    So now we can proceed as followings:\n     \n\n\n    Since the integers are closed under addition, we conclude that   is an integer and so the last equation implies that 8 divides  . We can now write a proof. The following proof is written according to the writing guidelines in  .\n   \n        For all integers   and  , if   and  , then  .\n       \n        We assume that   and   are integers and that   and  . We will prove that  . From the assumptions, we conclude that\n         \n        So there exist integers   and   such that\n         \n        \n        Solving these equations for   and  , we obtain   and  . We can now substitute for   and   in the expression  . This gives\n         \n        Since the integers are closed under addition, we conclude that   is an integer and so the last equation implies that 8 divides  . So by the definition of congruece, we can conclude that  . This proves that for all integers   and  , if   and  , then  \n       Note \n      This shows a typical way to construct and write a direct proof of a proposition or theorem. We will not be going into this much detail on the construction process in all of the results proved in this book. In fact, most textbooks do not do this. What they most often show is only the final product as shown in the preceding proof. Do not be fooled that this is the way that proofs are constructed. Constructing a proof often requires trial and error and because of this, it is always a good idea to write down what is being assumed and what it is we are trying to prove. Then be willing to work backwards for what it is to be proved and works forwards from the assumptions. The hard part is often connecting the forward process to the backward process. This becomes extremely difficult if we do not write things down and try to work only in our heads.\n     \n    We will now consider the following proposition.\n   \n        For each integer  , if 7 divides  , then 7 divides  .\n       \n    If we think about starting a a proof, we would let   be an integer, assume that 7 divides   and from this assumption, try to prove that 7 divides  . That is, we would assume that there exists an integer   such that   and try to prove that there exists an integer   such that  . From the assumption, we can using factoring and conclude that\n     \n    There does not seem to be a direct way to prove that there is an integer   such that  . So we start looking for examples of integers   such that 7 divides   and see if 7 divides   for these examples. After trying a few examples, we find that for   and  , 7 divides   . (There are many other such values for  .) For  , we see that\n     \n    However, 7 does not divides 3. This shows that for  , the hypothesis of   is true and the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample for the proposition and proves that   is false.\n   Note counterexample Euclid's Lemma Euclid's Lemma Proposition \n      For each integer  , if 7 divides   , then 7 divides   or 7 divides  .\n     "

Instead of trying to construct a direct proof, it is sometimes easier to use a proof by contradiction so that we can assume that the something exists.\n   \n    We will illustrate this by proving the following proposition. Notice that the conclusion of the proposition involves trying to prove that an integer with a certain property does not exist. If we use a proof by contradiction, we can assume that such an integer   exists.

  "body": "Rational and Irrational Numbers \n    One of the most important ways to classify real numbers is as a rational number or an irrational number. Following is the definition of rational (and irrational) numbers given in  .\n   Definition irrational numbers rational numbers rational number irrational number \n    This may seem like a strange distinction because most people are quite familiar with the rational numbers (fractions) but the irrational numbers seem a bit unusual. However, there are many irrational numbers such as  ,  ,  ,  , and the number  .\n   \n    We use the symbol   to stand for the set of rational numbers. There is no standard symbol for the set of irrational numbers. Perhaps one reason for this is because of the closure properties of the rational numbers, namely that the rational numbers   are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero rational numbers. This means that if  , then\n     \n         \n           ,  , and   are in  ; and\n         \n       \n         \n           If  , then   is in  .\n         \n       \n   \n    The basic reasons for these facts are that if we add, subtract, multiply, or divide two fractions, the result is a fraction. One reason we do not have a symbol for the irrational numbers is that the irrational numbers are not closed under these operations. For example,   is irrational and we see that\n     \n    This shows that the product of irrational numbers can be rational and the quotient of irrational numbers can be rational.\n   \n    It is also important to realize that every integer is a rational number since any integer can be written as a fraction. For example, we can write   . In general, if  , then   , and hence,  .\n   \n    Because the rational numbers are closed under the standard operations and the definition of an irrational number simply says that the number is not rational, we often use a proof by contradiction to prove that a number is irrational. This is illustrated in the next proposition.\n   \n        For all real numbers   and  , if   is rational and   and   is irrational, then   is irrational.\n       \n        We will use a proof by contradiction.

We now know that   and   are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under multiplication, we conclude that\n         .\n        However,   and hence,   must be a rational number. Since a real number cannot be both rational and irrational, this is a contradiction to the assumption that   is irrational.

  "body": "Using Cases with the Division Algorithm \n    An important result for the set of integers is known as the Division Algorithm. This is somewhat of a misnomer since it is stated in terms of addition and multiplication. The reason for this is that the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication but is not closed under division. However, we have known for some time that when we divide one integer by another nonzero integer, we get a quotient and a remainder. For example, when we divide 337 by 6, we often write\n     .\n    When we multiply both sides of this equation by 6, we get\n     .\n    When we are working within the system of integers, the second equation is preferred over the first since the second one uses only integers and the operations of addition and multiplication, and the integers are closed under addition and multiplication. Following is a complete statement of the Division Algorithm.\n   The Division Algorithm Division Algorithm for cases \n      For all integers   and   with  , there exist unique integers   and   such that\n       .\n     the quotient the remainder \n    The Division Algorithm can sometimes be used to construct cases that can be used to prove a statement that is true for all integers. We have done this when we divided the integers into the even integers and the odd integers since even integers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 and odd integers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n   \n    Sometimes it is more useful to divide the integer   by an integer other than 2. For example, if   is divided by 3, there are three possible remainders: 0, 1, and 2. If   is divided by 4, there are four possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, and 3. The remainders form the basis for the cases.\n   \n    If the hypothesis of a proposition is that   is an integer,  then we can use the Division Algorithm to claim that there are unique integers   and   such that\n     \n    We can then divide the proof into the following three cases: (1)  ; (2)  ; and (3)  . This is done in  .\n   \n        If   is an integer, then 3 divides  .\n       \n        Let   be an integer.

We will prove that   is a bijection by proving it is both an injection and a surjection.\n       \n        To prove that   is an injection, we let   and   be real numbers (hence, in the domain of  ) and assume that  . This means that  . We can then subtract   from both sides of this equation and then divide both sides by   since   as follows:\n         \n        So we have proved that for all  , if  , then  , and hence,   is an injection.\n       \n        To prove that   is a surjection, we choose a real number   in the codomain of   . We need to prove that there exists an   such that  . Working backward, we see that if  , then   (since  ).

This implies that the function   is not a surjection. For example,   is in the codomain of   and   for all   in the domain of  .\n         A Function that Is Not an Injection but Is a Surjection \n          Let  , and define   by  .

As in  , we do know that   for all  .\n         \n          To see if it is a surjection, we must determine if it is true that for every  , there exists an   such that  . So we choose  . The goal is to determine if there exists an   such that\n           .\n          One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation (if possible) for  . Doing so, we get\n           \n          Now, since  , we know that   and hence that . This means that  . Hence, if we use  , then  , and\n           \n         \n          This proves that   is a surjection since we have shown that for all  , there exists an   such that  .

In   and  , the same mathematical formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions. However, one function was not a surjection and the other one was a surjection. This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective not only depends on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and codomain of the function.\n           \n         A Function that Is an Injection but Is Not a Surjection \n          Let  .

Following is a table of values for some inputs for the function  .\n         0 1 1 2 2 5 3 10 4 17 5 26 \n          Notice that the codomain is  , and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function. So it appears that the function   is not a surjection.\n         \n          To prove that   is not a surjection, pick an element of   that does not appear to be in the range. We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no   in the domain   such that  . So we assume that there exists an    with  . Then\n           \n          But this is not possible since  . Therefore, there is no   with  . This means that for every  ,  . Therefore, 3 is not in the range of  , and hence   is not a surjection.\n         \n          The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs, and hence that   is an injection.

This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective not only depends on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and codomain of the function.\n           \n         A Function that Is an Injection but Is Not a Surjection \n          Let  . Define   by  . (Notice that this is the same formula used in   and  .) Following is a table of values for some inputs for the function  .\n         0 1 1 2 2 5 3 10 4 17 5 26 \n          Notice that the codomain is  , and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function. So it appears that the function   is not a surjection.\n         \n          To prove that   is not a surjection, pick an element of   that does not appear to be in the range. We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no   in the domain   such that  . So we assume that there exists an    with  . Then\n           \n          But this is not possible since  . Therefore, there is no   with  . This means that for every  ,  . Therefore, 3 is not in the range of  , and hence   is not a surjection.\n         \n          The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs, and hence that   is an injection. To prove that   is an injection, assume that   (the domain) with  . Then\n           .\n          Since  , we know that   and  . So the preceding equation implies that  . Hence,   is an injection.\n         \n           \n            An Important Lesson. The functions in the three preceding examples all used the same formula to determine the outputs. The functions in   and   are not injections but the function in   is an injection. This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is injective not only depends on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain of the function.\n           \n         "

  "body": "Guidelines for Writing Mathematical Proofs writing guidelines \n    One of the most important forms of mathematical writing is writing mathematical proofs.\n    The writing of mathematical proofs is an acquired skill and takes a lot of practice.\n   \n    Following is a summary of all the writing guidelines introduced in the text.\n    This summary contains some standard conventions that are usually followed when writing a \n    mathematical proof.\n     \n       Know your audience \n         \n          Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended audience for a piece of writing.\n          In that way,\n          the writer can give the right amount of information at the proper level of \n          sophistication to communicate effectively.\n          This is especially true for mathematical writing.\n          For example,\n          if a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions manual \n          for instructors,\n          the writing would be brief with many details omitted.\n          However, if the writing was for a students' solution manual,\n          more details would be included.\n         \n       \n         Begin with a carefully worded statement of the theorem or result to be proven \n         \n\n          The statement should be a simple declarative statement of the problem.\n          Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on a handout.\n          Problems often begin with phrases such as\n           Show that \n          or\n           Prove that. \n          This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem.\n          Then skip a line and write\n           Proof \n          in italics or boldface font\n          (when using a word processor).\n          Begin the proof on the same line.\n          Make sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified.\n          Skipping a line between paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.\n         \n         \n          As an example, an exercise in a text might read,\n           Prove that if   is an odd integer,\n          then   is an odd integer. \n          This could be started as follows:\n           \n            Theorem. If   is an odd integer,\n            then   is an odd integer.\n           \n           \n            Proof: We assume that   is an odd integer  .\n           \n         \n       \n         Begin the proof with a statement of your assumptions \n         \n          Follow the statement of your assumptions with a statement of what you will prove.\n           \n            Proof.\n            We assume that   and   are odd integers and will prove that \n              is an odd integer.\n           \n         \n       \n         Use the pronoun\n           we \n         \n          If a pronoun is used in a proof,\n          the usual convention is to use\n           we \n          instead of\n           I. \n          The idea is to stress that you and the reader are doing the mathematics together.\n          It will help encourage the reader to continue working through the mathematics.\n          Notice that we started the proof of   with\n           We assume that  . \n         \n       \n         Use italics for variables when using a word processor \n         \n\n          When using a word processor to write mathematics,\n          the word processor needs to be capable of producing the appropriate mathematical \n          symbols and equations.\n          The mathematics that is written with a word processor should look like typeset mathematics.\n          This means that variables need to be italicized,\n          boldface is used for vectors,\n          and regular font is used for mathematical terms such as the names of the trigonometric \n          functions and logarithmic functions.\n          For example, we do not write sin x or  .\n          The proper way to typeset this is  .\n         \n       \n         Do not use   for multiplication or ^ for exponents \n         \n   \n          Leave this type of notation for writing computer code.\n          The use of this notation makes it difficult for humans to read.\n          In addition,\n          avoid using   for division when using a complex fraction.\n         \n         \n          For example,\n          it is very difficult to read  ;\n          the fraction\n           \n          is much easier to read.\n         \n       \n         Use complete sentences and proper paragraph structure \n         \n    \n          Good grammar is an important part of any writing.\n          Therefore, conform to the accepted rules of grammar.\n          Pay careful attention to the structure of sentences.\n          Write proofs using  complete sentences \n          but avoid run-on sentences.\n          Also, do not forget punctuation,\n          and always use a spell checker when using a word processor.\n         \n       \n         Keep the reader informed \n         \n\n          Sometimes a theorem is proven by proving the contrapositive or by using a proof \n          by contradiction.\n          If either proof method is used,\n          this should be indicated within the first few lines of the proof.\n          This also applies if the result is going to be proven using mathematical induction.\n          Examples:\n           \n               \n                We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement.\n               \n             \n               \n                We will prove this statement using a proof by contradiction.\n               \n             \n               \n                We will assume to the contrary that  .\n               \n             \n               \n                We will use mathematical induction to prove this result.\n               \n             \n        \n        In addition,\n        make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that is made.\n        That is, make sure it is clearly stated whether an assertion is an assumption of the theorem,\n        a previously proven result, a well-known result,\n        or something from the reader's mathematical background.\n         \n       \n         Display important equations and mathematical expressions \n         \n\n          Equations and manipulations are often an integral part of the exposition.\n          Do not write equations, algebraic manipulations,\n          or formulas in one column with reasons given in another column\n          (as is often done in geometry texts).\n          Important equations and manipulations should be displayed.\n          This means that they should be centered with blank lines before and after the \n          equation or manipulations,\n          and if one side of an equation does not change,\n          it should not be repeated.\n          For example,  Using algebra, we obtain\n           .\n          Since     and     are integers,\n          we conclude that  .\n         \n       \n         Equation numbering guidelines \n         \n\n          If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof,\n          that equation should be centered and displayed,\n          and it should be given a number.\n          The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the \n          equation at the right-hand margin.\n         \n         \n          Example: Since     is an odd integer,\n          there exists an integer     such that\n           .\n          Later in the proof, there may be a line such as Then,\n          using the result in equation  , we obtain  .\n          Please note that we should only number those equations we will be referring to later \n          in the proof.\n          Also, note that the word\n           equation \n          is not capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number.\n          Although it may be appropriate to use a capital\n           E, \n          the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.\n         \n       \n         Do not use a mathematical symbol at the beginning of a sentence \n         \n          For example, we should not write,\n           Let   be an integer.\n            is an odd integer provided that  . \n          Many people find this hard to read and often have to re-read it to understand it.\n          It would be better to write,\n           An integer   is an odd integer provided that  . \n         \n       \n         Use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation \n\n         \n          Do not use the special symbols for quantifiers  \n          (for all),\n           \n          (there exists),\n           \n          (such that),\n          or   (therefore) in formal mathematical writing.\n          It is often easier to write, and usually easier to read,\n          if the English words are used instead of the symbols.\n          For example, why make the reader interpret\n           \n          when it is possible to write For each real number  ,\n          there exists a real number   such that  ,\n          or more succinctly\n          (if appropriate)\n          Every real number has an additive inverse.\n         \n       \n         Tell the reader when the proof has been completed \n         \n          Perhaps the best way to do this is to say outright that,\n           This completes the proof. \n          Although it may seem repetitive,\n          a good alternative is to finish a proof with a sentence that states precisely what has \n          been proven.\n          In any case, it is usually good practice to use some\n           end of proof symbol \n          such as  .\n         \n       \n         Keep it simple \n         \n          It is often difficult to understand a mathematical argument no matter how well it is written.\n          Do not let your writing help make it more difficult for the reader.\n          Use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs,\n          each with a simple point.\n         \n       \n         Write a first draft of your proof and then revise it \n         \n          Remember that a proof is written so that readers are able to read and understand \n          the reasoning in the proof.\n          Be clear and concise.\n          Include details but do not ramble.\n          Do not be satisfied with the first draft of a proof.\n          Read it over and refine it.\n          Just like any worthwhile activity,\n          learning to write mathematics well takes practice and hard work.\n          This can be frustrating.\n          Everyone can be sure that there will be some proofs that are difficult to construct,\n          but remember that proofs are a very important part of mathematics.\n          So work hard and have fun.\n         \n       \n   "
