            Is the following proposition true or false? Justify your conclusion with a counterexample (if it is false) or a proof (if it is true).
            <blockquote>
              Propostion. For each integer <m>n</m>, if <m>\modulo{n}{2}{4}</m>, then <m>\notmodulo{n}{3}{6}</m>.

          Prove the following proposition:
          <blockquote>
            Proposition. For all real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, if <m>x</m> is rational and <m>x \ne 0</m> and <m>y</m> is irrational, then <m>x + y</m> is irrational.
