  <title>Direct Proofs</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In order to prove that a conditional statement <m>P \to Q</m> is true, we only need to prove that <m>Q</m> is true whenever <m>P</m> is true. This is because the conditional statement is true whenever the hypothesis is false. So in a direct proof of <m>P \to Q</m>, we assume that <m>P</m> is true, and using this assumption, we proceed through a logical sequence of steps to arrive at the conclusion that <m>Q</m> is true. Unfortunately, it is often not easy to discover how to start this logical sequence of steps or how to get to the conclusion that <m>Q</m> is true. We will describe a method of exploration that often can help in discovering the steps of a proof. This method will involve working forward from the hypothesis, <m>P</m>, and backward from the conclusion, <m>Q</m>. We will illustrate this “forward-backward” method with the following proposition.
