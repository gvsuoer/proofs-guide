    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use a counterexample to prove the following statement is false.
          <blockquote>
            For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if 5 divides <m>a</m> or 5 divides <m>b</m>, then 5 divides <m>(5a + b)</m>.
          </blockquote>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          A counterexample for this statement will be values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> for which 5 divides <m>a</m> or 5 divides <m>b</m>, and 5 does not divide <m>5a + b</m>. One counterexample for the statement is <m>a = 5</m> and <m>b = 1</m>. For these values, the hypothesis is true since 5 divides <m>a</m> and the conclusion is false since <m>5a + b = 26</m> and 5 does not divide 26.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Construct a table of values for <m>3m^2 + 4m + 6</m> using at least six different integers for <m>m</m>. Make one-half of the values for <m>m</m> even integers and the other half odd integers. Is the following proposition true or false?
          <blockquote>
            If <m>m</m> is an odd integer, then <m>3m^2 + 4m + 6</m> is an odd integer.
          </blockquote>
          Justify your conclusion. This means that if the proposition is true, then you should write a proof of the proposition. If the proposition is false, you need to provide an example of an odd integer for which <m>3m^2 + 4m + 6</m> is an even integer.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          All examples should indicate the proposition is true. Following is a proof. 
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We assume that <m>m</m> is an odd integer and will prove that <m>( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 )</m> . Since <m>m</m> is an odd integer, there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>m = 2k + 1</m>. Substituting this into the expression <m>( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 )</m> and using algebra, we obtain
            <md>
              <mrow>3m^2 + 4m + 6  \amp = 3 (2k + 1)^2 + 4 (2k+1) + 6</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (12k^2 + 12k + 3 ) + (8k + 4) + 6</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 12k^2 + 20k + 13</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 12k^2 + 20k + 12 + 1</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 2 (6k^2 + 10k + 6) + 1</mrow>
            </md>
             By the closure properties of the integers, <m>(6k^2 + 10k + 6)</m> is an integer, and hence, the last equation shows that <m>( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 )</m> is an odd integer.
          </p>
          <p>
            This proves that if <m>m</m> is an odd integer, then <m>( 3m^2 + 4m + 6 )</m> is an odd integer.
          </p>
        </proof>

    <exercise>
    <idx><h>Pythagorean Theorem</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
           The <term>Pythagorean Theorem</term> for right triangles states that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse, then <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m> . For example, if <m>a = 5</m> and <m>b = 12</m> are the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle and if <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse, then the <m>c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2</m> and so <m>c^2 = 169</m>. Since <m>c</m> is a length and must be positive, we conclude that <m>c = 13</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Construct and provide a well-written proof for the following proposition.
          <blockquote>
            Proposition. If <m>m</m> is a real number and <m>m</m>, <m>m + 1</m>, and <m>m + 2</m> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle, then <m>m = 3</m>.
          </blockquote>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We let <m>m</m> be a real number and assume that <m>m</m>, <m>m + 1</m>, and <m>m + 2</m> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle. We will use the Pythagorean Theorem to prove that <m>m = 3</m>. Since the hypotenuse is the longest of the three sides, the Pythagorean Theorem implies that <m>m^2 + (m + 1)^2 = (m+ 2)^2</m>. We will now use algebra to rewrite both sides of this equation as follows
            <md>
              <mrow>m^2 + (m^2 + 2m + 1) \amp = m^2 + 4m + 4</mrow>
              <mrow>2m^2 + 2m +1 \amp = m^2 + 4m + 4</mrow>
            </md>
            The last equation is a quadratic equation. To solve for <m>m</m>, we rewrite the equation in standard form and then factor the left side. This gives
            <md>
              <mrow>m^2 - 2m - 3 \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>(m-3)(m + 1) \amp = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            The two solutions of this equation are <m>m = 3</m> and <m>m = 1</m>. However, since m is the length of a side of a right triangle, <m>m</m> must be positive and we conclude that <m>m = 3</m>. This proves that if <m>m</m>, <m>m + 1</m>, and <m>m + 2</m> are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle, then <m>m =3</m>.
          </p>

    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>
           Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> be integers. Prove each of the following.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
             If <m>\modulo{a}{b}{n}</m> and <m>\modulo{c}{d}{n}</m>, then <m>\modulo{(a + c)}{(b + d)}{n}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For both parts, we assume that n is a natural number and <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are integers and that <m>\modulo{a}{b}{n}</m> and <m>\modulo{c}{d}{n}</m>. We can then conclude that <m>n</m> divides <m>a - b</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>c - d</m>. So there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>a - b \amp = kn \amp \amp \text{and} \amp c - d \amp = mn</mrow>
              <mrow>a \amp = b+ kn \amp \amp \text{and} \amp c \amp = d+ mn</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We then see that
            <md>
              <mrow>( a + c ) - ( b + d ) \amp = (a - b) + (c - d)</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = kn + mn</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (k + m)n</mrow>
            </md>
            Since the integers are closed under addition, <m>k + m</m> is an integer and the last equation proves that <m>\modulo{a + c}{b + d}{n}</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>\modulo{a}{b}{n}</m> and <m>\modulo{c}{d}{n}</m>, then <m>\modulo{ac}{bd}{n}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For both parts, we assume that n is a natural number and <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are integers and that <m>\modulo{a}{b}{n}</m> and <m>\modulo{c}{d}{n}</m>. We can then conclude that <m>n</m> divides <m>a - b</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>c - d</m>. So there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>a - b \amp = kn \amp \amp \text{and} \amp c - d \amp = mn</mrow>
              <mrow>a \amp = b+ kn \amp \amp \text{and} \amp c \amp = d+ mn</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We then see that
            <md>
              <mrow>ac - bd \amp = (b + kn)(d + mn) - bd</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = ( bd + bmn + knd + kmn^2) - bd</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (bm + kd + kmn)n</mrow>
            </md>
            Since the integers are closed under addition and multiplication, <m>(bm + kd + kmn)</m> is an integer and the last equation proves that <m>\modulo{ac}{bd}{n}</m>.
          </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          One way to prove that two sets are equal is to prove that each one is a subset of the other one. Consider the following proposition:
          <blockquote>
            Proposition. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set. Then <m>A - (A - B) = A \cap B</m>.
          </blockquote>
          
          Prove this proposition is true or give a counterexample to prove it is false.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The proposition is true. Use the choose-an-element method to prove that each set is a subset of the other set.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of some universal set. We will prove that <m>A - (A - B) = A \cap B</m> by proving that <m>A - (A - B) \subseteq A \cap B</m> and that <m>A \cap B \subseteq A - (A - B)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let <m>x \in A - (A - B)</m>. This means that
            <me>
              x \in A \text{ and } x \not \in (A - B)
            </me>.
            We know that an element is in <m>(A - B)</m> if and only if it is in <m>A</m> and not in <m>B</m>. Since <m>x \not \in (A - B)</m>, we conclude that <m>x \not \in A</m><m>x \in B</m>. However, we also know that <m>x \in A</m> and so we conclude that <m>x \in B</m>. This proves that
            <me>
              x \in A \text{ and } x \in B
            </me>
            This means that <m>x \in A \cap B</m>, and hence we have proved that <m>A - (A - B) \subseteq A \cap B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now choose <m>y \in A \cap B</m>. This means that 
            <me>
              y \in A \text{ and } y \in B
            </me>.
            We note that <m>y \in (A - B)</m> if and only if <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \not \in B</m> and hence, <m>y \not \in (A - B)</m> if and only if <m>y \not \in A</m> or <m>y \in B</m>. Since we have proved that <m>y \in B</m>, we can conclude that <m>y \not \in (A - B)</m>, and hence, we have established that <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \not \in (A - B)</m>. So, <m>y \in A - (A - B)</m>, and this proves that if <m>y \in A \cap B</m>, then <m>y \in A - (A - B)</m> and hence, <m>A \cap B \subseteq A - (A - B)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we have proved that <m>A - (A - B) \subseteq A \cap B</m> and <m>A \cap B \subseteq A - (A - B)</m>, we conclude that <m>A - (A - B) = A \cap B</m>.
