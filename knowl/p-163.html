<p>We will use a proof by contradiction to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\)</span> is an irrational number. So we assume that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\)</span> is a rational number and so we can write <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} = r\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a rational number and <span class="process-math">\(r \ne 0\text{.}\)</span> We now rewrite this equation and then square both sides of the resulting equation to obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{3} \amp  = r - \sqrt{2}\\
3 \amp = r^2 - 2r \sqrt{2} + 2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We continue and rewrite this equation to isolate <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> on one side of the equation.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
2r \sqrt{2} \amp = r^2 - 1\\
\sqrt{2} \amp = \frac{r^2 - 1}{2r}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(r \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2r \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> and since the rational numbers are closed under division by a nonzero rational number, the last equation shows that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is a rational number. This is a contradiction since it is known that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is irrational. This proves that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\)</span> is an irrational number.</p>
