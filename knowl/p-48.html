<p>So we first know that the goal is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\modulo{(a + b)}{3}{8}\text{.}\)</span> So a “backwards question” is, “How do we prove <span class="process-math">\(\modulo{(a + b)}{3}{8}\text{?}\)</span>” We may be able to answer this question in different ways depending on whether or not we have some previously proven results, but we can always use the definition. So an answer to this question is, “We can prove that 8 divides <span class="process-math">\((a + b) - 3\text{.}\)</span>” We now ask, “How can we prove that 8 divides <span class="process-math">\((a + b) - 3\text{?}\)</span>” Again, we can use the definition and answer that we can prove that there exists an integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((a + b) - 3 = 8k\text{.}\)</span> So here is what we should have written down.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(Q\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\modulo{(a + b)}{3}{8}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(Q1\text{:}\)</span> 8 divides <span class="process-math">\((a + b) - 3\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(Q2\text{:}\)</span> There exists and integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((a + b) - 3 = 8k\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The idea is that if we can prove that <span class="process-math">\(Q2\)</span> is true, then we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q1\)</span> is true, and then we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. <span class="process-math">\(Q2\)</span> is a good place to stop the backwards process since it involves proving that something exists and we have an equation with which to work. So we start the forwards process. We start by writing down the assumptions stated in the hypothesis of the proposition and then make conclusions based on these assumptions. While doing this, we look at the items in the backward process and try to find ways to connect the conclusions in the forward process to the backward process. The forward process can be summarized as</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(P\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are integers and <span class="process-math">\(\modulo{a}{5}{8}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\modulo{b}{6}{8}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(P1\text{:}\)</span> 8 divides <span class="process-math">\(a - 5\)</span> and 8 divides <span class="process-math">\(b - 6\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(P2\text{:}\)</span> There exists and integer <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a - 5 = 8m\)</span> and there exists and integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(b - 6 = 8n\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">It now seems that there is a way to connect the forward part (<span class="process-math">\(P2\)</span>) to the backward part <span class="process-math">\((Q2)\)</span> using the existence of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (which have been proven to exist) and the equations in <span class="process-math">\(P2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q2\text{.}\)</span></p>
