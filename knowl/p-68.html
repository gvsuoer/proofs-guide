<p>One of the most basic types of proofs involving sets is to prove that one set is a subset of another set. If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> are both subsets of some univesal set <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> to prove that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> we need to prove that <blockquote class="blockquote">For each element in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x \in S\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in T\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> When we have to prove something that involves a universal quantifier, we frequently use a method that can be called the <dfn class="terminology">choose-an-element method</dfn>. The key is that we have to prove something about all elements in <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{.}\)</span> We can then add something to the forward process by choosing an arbitrary element from the set <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> This does not mean that we can choose a specific element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Rather, we must give the arbitrary element a name and use only the properties it has by being a member of the set <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span></p>
