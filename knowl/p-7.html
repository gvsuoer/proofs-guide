<p>Definitions play a very important role in mathematics. A direct proof of a proposition in mathematics is often a demonstration that the proposition follows logically from certain definitions and previously proven propositions. A <dfn class="terminology">definition</dfn> is an agreement that a particular word or phrase will stand for some object, property, or other concept that we expect to refer to often. In many elementary proofs, the answer to the question, “How do we prove a certain proposition?”, is often answered by means of a definition. For mathematical proofs, we need very precise and carefully worded definitions.</p>
