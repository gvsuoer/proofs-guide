<p>In order to prove that a conditional statement <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is true, we only need to prove that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true whenever <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true. This is because the conditional statement is true whenever the hypothesis is false. So in a direct proof of <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{,}\)</span> we assume that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true, and using this assumption, we proceed through a logical sequence of steps to arrive at the conclusion that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. Unfortunately, it is often not easy to discover how to start this logical sequence of steps or how to get to the conclusion that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true. We will describe a method of exploration that often can help in discovering the steps of a proof. This method will involve working forward from the hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and backward from the conclusion, <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> We will illustrate this “forward-backward” method with the following proposition.</p>
