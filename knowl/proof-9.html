<p>We will prove that for all integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is even, then <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is even or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is even by proving its contrapositive, which is: <blockquote class="blockquote">For all integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is odd and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd, then <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is odd.</blockquote> So we assume that both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are odd integers and will prove that <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is an odd integer. Since <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are odd, there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a = 2k + 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 2m + 1\text{.}\)</span> Using substitution and algebra, we then see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
ab \amp = (2k + 1)(2m +1)\\
\amp = 4km + 2k + 2m + 1\\
\amp = 2 (2km + k + m) + 1
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are integers, the closure properties of the integers allow us to conclude that <span class="process-math">\((2km + k + m)\)</span> is an integer. This means that <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> has been written as two times an integer plus 1, and hence <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is an odd integer. This proves that for all integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is odd and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is odd, then <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is odd, which is the contrapositive of the proposition. So we have proved that For all integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> is even, then <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is even or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is even.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_other_exer.html#proof-9" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
