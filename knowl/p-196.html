<p>An important result for the set of integers is known as the Division Algorithm. This is somewhat of a misnomer since it is stated in terms of addition and multiplication. The reason for this is that the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication but is not closed under division. However, we have known for some time that when we divide one integer by another nonzero integer, we get a quotient and a remainder. For example, when we divide 337 by 6, we often write</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{337}{6} = 56 + \frac{1}{6}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">When we multiply both sides of this equation by 6, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
337 = 6 \cdot 56 + 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">When we are working within the system of integers, the second equation is preferred over the first since the second one uses only integers and the operations of addition and multiplication, and the integers are closed under addition and multiplication. Following is a complete statement of the Division Algorithm.</p>
