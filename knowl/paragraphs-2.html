<p>This shows a typical way to construct and write a direct proof of a proposition or theorem. We will not be going into this much detail on the construction process in all of the results proved in this book. In fact, most textbooks do not do this. What they most often show is only the final product as shown in the preceding proof. Do not be fooled that this is the way that proofs are constructed. Constructing a proof often requires trial and error and because of this, it is always a good idea to write down what is being assumed and what it is we are trying to prove. Then be willing to work backwards for what it is to be proved and works forwards from the assumptions. The hard part is often connecting the forward process to the backward process. This becomes extremely difficult if we do not write things down and try to work only in our heads.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_cong_divides.html#paragraphs-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
