<p>We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, and <span class="process-math">\(x + y\)</span> is rational. Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational, we know that <span class="process-math">\(-x\)</span> is rational. Since the rational numbers are closed under addition, we know that <span class="process-math">\((-x) + (x + y)\)</span> is rational, and we see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
(-x) + (x + y) \amp = ((-x) + x) + y\\
\amp = 0 + y\\
\amp = y
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">However, this shows that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must be a rational number, but we have also assumed that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational. Since a real number cannot be both rational and irrational, this is a contradiction. We have therefore proved that for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, then <span class="process-math">\(x + y\)</span> is irrational.</p></article></div></body>
