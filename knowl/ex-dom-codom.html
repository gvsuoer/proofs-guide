<p>Is the function <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> a surjection?

<p>To see if it is a surjection, we must determine if it is true that for every <span class="process-math">\(y \in T\text{,}\)</span> there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(F (x) = y\text{.}\)</span> So we choose <span class="process-math">\(y \in T\text{.}\)</span> The goal is to determine if there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\)</span> such that</p>

<p class="continuation">One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation (if possible) for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Doing so, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x^2 \amp = y - 1\\
x = \sqrt{y - 1} \amp \text{ or } x = - \sqrt{y - 1}

<p class="continuation">Now, since <span class="process-math">\(y \in T\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(y \geq 1\)</span> and hence that<span class="process-math">\(y - 1 \geq 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{y - 1} \in \R\text{.}\)</span> Hence, if we use <span class="process-math">\(x = \sqrt{y - 1}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\text{,}\)</span> and</p>

<p>This proves that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a surjection since we have shown that for all <span class="process-math">\(y \in T\text{,}\)</span> there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(F (x) = y\text{.}\)</span> Notice that for each <span class="process-math">\(y \in T\text{,}\)</span> this was a constructive proof of the existence of an <span class="process-math">\(x \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = y\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>Notice that the codomain is <span class="process-math">\(\N\text{,}\)</span> and the table of values suggests that some natural numbers are not outputs of this function. So it appears that the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not a surjection.</p>
<p>To prove that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not a surjection, pick an element of <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> that does not appear to be in the range. We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove that there is no <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain <span class="process-math">\((\Z ^* )\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 3\text{.}\)</span> So we assume that there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x \in \Z\)</span>  with <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 3\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">

x^2 + 1 \amp = 3\\
x^2 \amp = 2\\
x \amp = \pm \sqrt{2}

<p class="continuation">But this is not possible since <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} \not \in \Z ^*\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, there is no <span class="process-math">\(x \in \Z ^*\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 3\text{.}\)</span> This means that for every <span class="process-math">\(x \in \Z ^*\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g(x) \ne 3\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, 3 is not in the range of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not a surjection.</p>
<p>The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs, and hence that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an injection. To prove that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is an injection, assume that <span class="process-math">\(s, t \in \Z ^*\)</span> (the domain) with <span class="process-math">\(g(s) = g(t)\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
