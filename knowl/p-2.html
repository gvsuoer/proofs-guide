<p>With the exception of <a href="C_preliminaries.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Preliminaries">Chapter 1</a>, each chapter in the book has a description of a proof technique along with some justification as to why it is a valid proof method. There are then one or two completed proofs written according to the writing guidelines for mathematical proofs in <a href="app_guidelines.html" class="internal" title="Appendix A: Guidelines for Writing Mathematical Proofs">Appendix A</a>. The intent is to illustrate a well-written proof for that particular proof method. Each chapter then ends with three to five practice problems, most of which deal with mathematical proofs. Completed proofs (or solutions) for the practice problems are contained in <a href="app_solutions.html" class="internal" title="Appendix B: Answers and Hints for the Practice Problems">Appendix B</a>. So students can check their work or see other examples of well-written proofs. <a href="C_preliminaries.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Preliminaries">Chapter 1</a> contains most of the definitions used in the first six chapters of this book and a short summary of some logic that is pertinent to constructing mathematical proofs.</p>
